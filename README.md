# What is it?
Leren is a simple Excel-based reporting engine. It helps to make a report in excel in fast-and-easy-to-make manner. You have to describe data sources right inside a cell of excel worksheet. It supports multi-level data structures and poor engine-provided formatting options. But anyway, you always have the power of excel to format cells and values as you wish.

One of the most interesting benefits is that all of your formulas and VBA code stay alive and work as you expect them to. Every row or column insertion forces formulas to shift cell references (or not, if there is a dollar sign).

In fact, there is a way to make a "live" report. You can generate report with a lot of formulas, VBA code and so on. User is able to change some data and see changes in the same moment.

# Quick start!
1. Make an empty excel file and name it "file1.xlsx"
2. Type in cell A1 of worksheet: `{COLL=Apples/Green;WIDTH=2}`
3. Type in cell B1 of worksheet: `{Size}`
4. Now it looks like:  

|   |                       A                   |   B    |   C   |
|---|-------------------------------------------|--------|-------|
| 1 | {COLL=Apples/Green;WIDTH=2}               | {Size} |       |
| 2 |                                           |        |       |

5. Let's describe data model:
```c#
public class GreenApple
{
   public double Size {set;get;}
}
public class Apples
{
  public List<GreenApple> Green {set;get;}
}
public class Root
{
  public Apples Apples {set;get;}
}
```
5. Ok, it's time to generate a report
```c#
// add some data
var root = new Root();
root.Apples = new Apples();
root.Apples.Green = new List<GreenApple>();
root.Apples.Green.Add(new GreenApple{Size = 5});
root.Apples.Green.Add(new GreenApple{Size = 10});

// making report
IReportEngine engine = new Engine();
engine.Provider = new ReflectionProvider(root);
engine.Go(@"file.xlsx", @"report.xlsx");
```
Now open the file `report.xlsx` to see what's generated. Or, you can see it here:

|   |                       A                   |   B    |   C   |
|---|-------------------------------------------|--------|-------|
| 1 |                                           | 5      |       |
| 2 |                                           | 10     |       |

# How does it work?

## Data provider
At first, select a data provider. Some of them are ready out-of-box:
- Reflection provider for data stored in a tree of objects
- Xml Provider for data stored in xml file
- MySql provider for data stored in MySql database
- Oracle provider for data stored in Oracle database
- Posgre provider for data stored in Postgre database

## Custom data provider
If you aren't satisfied with capabilities that are ready out-of-the-box you can always implement data provider by yourself. Implement **IProvider** interface in order to use your own data provider.

```c#
public interface IProvider
    {
        int GetCollectionCount(string path, string tag, List<ContextItem> context);
        object GetValue(string path, string tag, List<ContextItem> context);
        ImageInfo GetImage(string path, string tag, List<ContextItem> context);
    }
```
## Report definition language
There is a syntax for data source definition: curly brackets and special words. There are only three types of definitions: **collection**, **property** and **picture**.

## Syntax for Reflection Provider

Use collection definition in order to make some cells repeat itself x times. Here is a sample of such definition:
```
{COLL=Root/SomeProperty/SomeCollection;HEIGHT=1;WIDTH=10;GROW=DOWN;INSERT=YES;TAG=sometag}
```
Arguments are described below:
- COLL= is a path to property, each element (property) is separated with **"/"** or **"."**, starting from the root of data model. When you place one collection inside another, you have to specify path to collection starting from current item (context).
- HEIGHT - describes height of repeatable block, for example 2 means two cells hight, starting from current cell.
- WIDTH - describes width of repeatable block, for example 3 means three cells width, starting from current cell.
- GROW - grow direction. Use 'right' to make it grow right, or 'down' for growing down.
- INSERT - when it's set to 'no', inserting of cells is not performed while processing current collection. Insertion of row may slow down performance of report generation process, thus, default value is 'no'. 'No' means that cells that lay lower than (or to the right, see parameter 'GROW') repeatable block are overwritten by copies of it. 'Yes' means that insertion is performed and no data is overwritten, just shifted to the right or down.
- TAG - anything you want to store here. Out-of-box provideres don't use this information. Custom providers receive tags and may do some extra stuff if required.
- NESTED - useful for DB providers, we will talk more about it later.

Use property definition to display data. Here is full sample:
```
{Car1/Wheel1/Diam;MULT=3.1;ADD=100;FORMAT=0.000;NOTE=Note;TAG=ha-ha}
```
Arguments are described below:
- necessary argument is a path to property. Use fully-qualified path, starting from data root, or starting from current item, when you are in a collection context.
- MULT multiples property value by it's argument.
- ADD adds argument to property value or to result of MULT, if MULT is specified.
- FORMAT is formatting numeric property value. For example, to get only 3.14 from PI, use format `0.00`
- NOTE is here to add a comment to cell if required. If pointed property return `null` no comment is added
- TAG - anything you want to store here. Tags are passed to data providers.

Use picture definition to add a picture to sheet. Here is full sample:

```
{PIC=path/to/picture;WIDH=100;HEIGHT=100;TAG=ha-ha;UNIT=PX}
```

Arguments are described below:

- PIC necessary argument is a path to property. Use fully-qualified path, starting from data root, or starting from current item, when you are in a collection context. Property must points at `ImageInfo` object
- UNIT is 'px' which means pixels, or 'perc', which means percent. It is a unit of measure of picture
- WIDTH is a width of picture, in pixel or percent, depends on UNIT value
- HEIGHT is a height of picture, in pixel or percent, depends on UNIT value

## Language for Oracle Provider

As for Oracle provider, use COLL to describe query that returns data. Other properties are used to perform same things, excluding **nested**. When you write a column name (of sql) in nested, it automatically becomes available for querying as a parameter in underlying collections/requests. There is a sample that makes it simple to understand.

At first, let's make a provider to DB. I have an Oracle DB.
```c#
IReportEngine re = new Engine();
re.Provider = new OracleProvider(@"DATA SOURCE=localhost/sid;PASSWORD=SWORDFISH;PERSIST SECURITY INFO=True;USER ID=JOHN");
(re.Provider as OracleProvider).Parameters.Add("ARG1", "OP");
re.Go(@"C:\TEMP\template.xlsx", @"C:\TEMP\generated.xlsx");
```
^ Take a look, we passed a parameter: `ARG1`.

And here is what we placed in Excel worksheet. In cell A1 we use passed parameter.

|   |                       A                     | B |
|---|---------------------------------------------|---|
| 1 | {Coll=*select object_name from user_objects where object_type='TABLE' and object_name like **:ARG1** \|\| '%'*;width=2;height=3;**nested=object_name**} |   |
| 2 | {OBJECT_NAME} |   |
| 3 | {COLUMN_NAME}{Coll=*select column_name, table_name from all_tab_columns where table_name=**:object_name** order by column_name*;width=1;height=1;grow=down} |   |
| 4 |                                             |   |

Nested value **object_name** from query of cell A1 is passed as a parameter to query of cell A3.

Result is here:

**paste result here**

## Language for MySql Provider

MySql provider is same as Oracle's one, excepting the fact you have to write queries with MySql dialect and pass parameters via MySql's `@param` syntax.

## Language for Postgre Provider

Same as Oracle

## Language for XML Provider
